"        Initial version
"       
" Known Limited:
"     This indent file can not work well, when you break the long line into
"     multi-line manually, such as:
"      always @(posedge a or posedge b 
"          or posedge c ) begin
"         //...
"      end 
"     Recommend to use the coding style(wraped by vim automatically) as following:
"       always @(posedge a or posedge b or posedge c ) begin
"         //...
"       end
